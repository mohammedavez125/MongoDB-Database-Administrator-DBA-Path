monogodb is general purpose document database

Document > Collection > Database

document is similar to json object
It is displayed in json and stored in bson(binary json)

_id is primary field

documents may contain different fields and fields may contain different types

Flexibility:-
update classes to include new fields and start inserting documents with new schema

it supports polymorphic document (means that in one collection you have many versions of document schema)
